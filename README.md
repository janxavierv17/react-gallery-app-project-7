<h1> Project - React Gallery App </h1> <br/>
Please run the following line of codes in your terminal: <br/>
<pre> npm install & npm start </pre> <br/>

<h2>Project Overview </h2>
I used a very popular in demand React Library to create a Single Page image gallery app. <br/>

<ul>
    <li>I used JavaScript and JSX to build out the gallery components in a mondular fashion.</li> <br/>
    <li>I've set up a navigation bar with the help of React Router </li> <br/>
    <li> I used Fetch API to fetch data from Flickr and store those data in my Application's State component.</li> <br/>
    <li>Added logic to handle the search input. </li> <br/>
    <li>Added CSS to personalize the project </li> <br/>
</ul>

<h2>Challenges: </h2>
<ul>
    <li>Using State, Props and passing down functions to child components was abit tricky. But i"m getting a hang of it.</li> <br/>
    <li>Did alot of research and rewatching of videos to finish the project</li> <br/>
</ul>
